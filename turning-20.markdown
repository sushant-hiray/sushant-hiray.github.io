> Dear Blossy,

So now you're about to turn twenty, just a year left to be able to "officially drink" eh. 

```
Leaving your teenage years behind, 
what's in front of you, you're yet to find.
```

Oh, you beautiful, wonderful, brilliant girl. I wish I could travel back in time and squeeze you and hug you and tell you all about the amazing adventures you're going to have this year. You're about to enter the next year at college and well you've done pretty well there. Straight A's anyone? All's well that ends well after all. Real life now seems both light years away and scarily fast-approaching. 

Now that you start your job and get a flashy SSN and earn loads of money to shop, there'll some significant changes that'll become a part and parcel of your life. You'll have to please people just so that they don't screw you, but well, that's life. You will find people from all walks of life. There are certain things you might have to change, but well today's not the day to talk about them.

There are going to be people who tell you you're not good enough. Not smart enough. Not talented enough. Not beautiful enough. Not thin enough. Let the pain they cause thicken your skin, but don't carry them with you; they don't deserve your attention. You have much more important things to focus on.

There will be guys. So many guys. So many completely-wrong-but-totally-right-in-the-moment guys. Guys with no ambition. Guys who aspire to run the world. Guys you don't actually like very much, but think you should go out with anyway. Some of them will hurt your heart, but I hope that none will succeed in breaking it. There will always be one guy silently watching your back.

```
So here's something that's good to remember
All year long from January to December
Life's not about what is given on your plate
In the end, it's about what you create
```

You have adventure, success and love to look forward to.

Lots of love
<3
