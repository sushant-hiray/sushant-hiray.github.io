Dear Blossy,

I was the quiet, shy guy who rarely talked, let alone with a beautiful girl!
But perhaps I was wrong, very wrong. I still remember the day we started texting. It was all sublime, effortless. Probably the first of times when I wasn't perhaps awkward or I didn't say anything stupid (or this is what I like to think :P )

It all started from one small text and here I'm madly in love with my Blossy! :*

For me, Blossy is someone who cannot wait to get a hold of me at the end of the day to vividly describe every moment that passed. Someone for whom talking isn't about conveying information but about expressing and defining herself. Someone who, somehow, has a story perfect for every occasion. Someone who calls you 17 times a day and yet never interrupts what you were doing. Someone who gets home and spends the next half an hour talking, about some person whom you will probably never meet but will feel as if you grew up with them! Someone who makes me feel as if I'm there with here, seeing the world with her own eyes!

I've been on a date with you only once, but I can vividly remember you sitting waiting for me. On seeing, I perhaps stopped breathing for a moment, you looked so beautiful! The slight twinkle when I sat, the brief chuckle when I was awkward while ordering (sigh! shy much :P ), the smile worth dying for, the awesome expressions, the fumble of words to describe something particular, the joy when I lost the bet (I guess it was good, /me is working out :D) Walking you home instead of taking a cab hoping that, someday in the future, that walk would become a part of our seemingly endless collection :). There's just so much that happened in such little time. I guess its just you mesmerising me!

Spending a few months with you, I'm finding myself surrounded by a world which holds far more beauty and untold tales than I ever believed existed.

I so wish I could be there with you, right here in this moment. Hold your hands, give you a cute peck, have a lot of cheesecakes, go on a stroll and give you this letter. :)

Many many happy returns of the day, Blossy! :) 

I sooooo miss you! Enjoy your stay in Amrika. Become golumolu for me, will ya? :*

ps: To anyone who asks me for an advice this would be it: date a girl who talks just a tad too much because she will transform you into a person you never knew existed.


Lovingly yours,
Pervy
