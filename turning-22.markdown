> Dear Blossy,

So (hopefully) you must be wondering why did I not wish you. For starters, I'm home and planned to write this. But I've a really shitty internet to post this. This is fun though, I know you like reading letters and I like writing them. So last time I made a small one, this time a better version :) So here it goes.

Oh, you beautiful, wonderful, brilliant girl. I wish I could travel back in time and squeeze you and hug you and tell you all about the amazing adventures you're going to have. You're about to graduate from college and well you've done pretty well there. All's well that ends well after all. Real life now seems both light years away and scarily fast-approaching. 

Now that you start your job in a big company, office politics is something that'll become a part and parcel of your life. You'll have to please people just so that they don't screw you, but well, that's life. You will find people from all walks of life. There are certain things you might have to change about yourself, but well today's not the day to talk about them.

There are going to be people who tell you you're not good enough. Not smart enough. Not talented enough. Not beautiful enough. Not thin enough. Let the pain they cause thicken your skin, but don't carry them with you; they don't deserve your attention. You have much more important things to focus on.

There will be guys. So many guys. So many completely-wrong-but-totally-right-in-the-moment guys. Guys with no ambition. Guys who aspire to run the world. Guys you don't actually like very much, but think you should go out with anyway. Some of them will hurt your heart, but I'm hope that none will succeed in breaking it.

You have adventure, success and love to look forward to.

Lots of love
<3
