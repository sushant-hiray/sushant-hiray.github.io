What's your cheat day restaurant? If you're around Powai, you definitely need to pay a visit to Hakone in Hiranandani Gardens. You sir will be in for a scrumptuous treat. It comprises of an array of colorful mini-restaurants, with kitchens inside makeshift warehouse containers! 

Local Adda is one of these restaurants, it has a small outdoor seating, so you might've to wait before you get served, but they makeup with a cheesy menu to tempt your taste buds! And all this at a cost which you frankly wouldn't mind to spare!

We arrived at Local Adda, sadly on a day when the Rain Gods weren't particularly pleased. 

As the weather warranted, we started off by paying our homage to the Rain Gods with a nice cuppa of Kulhad Chai. After curing all the grumpiness, we were in for a feast of junk food. 

By the time we had the last sip of our chai, the kung pao fries were all set to be devoured. This was certainly a premonition of variety of food experiments we were going to experience for the meal. The Kung pao fries comprises of classic comfort fries topped with Kung Pao sauce. If like me, you've a soft corner for Kung Pao this definitely calls for a nice-to-have dish!

Up next was Pav Bhaji Cheese Toast, toast with a layer of pav bhaji squeezed in with a cheesy layer at the top. The cheese was overpowering the medley, which left me wanting for more. 

Next in line was the Italian Cheese Loaf. An open bread which is literally oozing with cheese, sprinkled with Italian herbs, and a dash of capsicum and onion. One can't simply say no to oozing cheese, so you already know what I've to say here, go try it already.

Now that we've already reached Italy, might as well sample some pasta along the way. We tried 2 variants of the pasta, Baked cheese pasta and the classic cheese sauce pasta. I would recommend giving baked cheese pasta a spin, only if you are a fan of baked cheese! If you aren't well you can try the cheese sauce pasta. Although the one we had was slightly dry, but that can be improved upon fairly easily!

Can't talk about cheesy food and not mention Pizza. So here we were, enjoying the 3-cheese Pizza. A sister variant of the classic 4-cheese pizza. Put simply, no nonsense cheesy pizza. 
The fries and cheese pizza however wasn't that appeasing. Quite generous on toppings, if you are in for that kind of thing. 

Moving on towards desserts, death by chocolate came highly recommended. A thick chocolate shake topped with miniature brownies. Some chocos are sprinkled, and no, adding chocos doesn't make it any more healthy! Perfect dessert for sharing, you would definitely regret not having it. 

Overall we had a pretty good experience. There were a few hits, and a few misses in the food department. However, if you are in for a quick snack without costing a bomb, this is the place for you.
