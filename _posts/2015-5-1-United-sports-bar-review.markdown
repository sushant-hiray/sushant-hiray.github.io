REVIEW:
======

We visited this happening place last night for a treat. The place is happening with loud music and huge projector screens showing some match. There is also a pool table if you fancy it. Overall the ambiance is great.

FOOD
===== 
We ordered a mix of veg and non veg finger food. We ordered veg platter which was particularly awesome. The paneer was soft and literally melt in the mouth. We ordered a couple of pizza's which were decent in taste. The non veg appetizers were great in general. We tried a handful of them.
As far as drinks are concerned they offered a variety of great cocktails along with the usual hard drinks.

Service 
========
The waiters were really enjoying the work. This is something which can be seen rarely, they also willing joined some of the groups while dancing. Overall this just improved the experience.

VFM 
====
They offer wide range of offers on drinks. 1+1 on Mondays and 50% off on Tuesdays.

PRO TIP
=======
They offer a 50% of on Tuesdays on the entire bill and that includes drinks! ?

FINAL VERDICT
============

* Food : 4/5
* Ambiance : 4/5
* Service : 4.5/5
* VFM : 4/5
* Overall : 4/5

Overall a must visit for birthday bashes and treats.
