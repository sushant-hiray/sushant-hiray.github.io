REVIEW:
======

I was meeting a friend of mine after a long time. We met at Matunga station and decided to head towards Hotel Ramashray. It is at a walking distance from the station.

We reached there at about 5 pm to find a huge waiting line. A typical udipi restaurant, this place is way too chaotic. You could find waiters running around taking orders and trying to get rid of the customers with their super speedy service.

After some waiting we finally advanced on the queue and got a place to sit. The sitting is on sharing basis, so we shared our table with a couple of other guys. This might be a huge turn off for a quite few people.

Seeing the chaos, I refrained from asking for the menu card. Later I came to know that they do not have any menu card â˜º. They have huge black boards where they mention the day's special. My friend is a frequent visitor so she just ordered a couple of plates of Idli, a rawa dosa, Pineapple sheera and filter coffee.

Within no time we were served with Idli-sambar and coconut chutney. The Idli was fresh but the coconut chutney was just awesome. I just couldn't get enough of it.

Next we were served with the Rawa dosa. This was the best rawa dosa I've ever had in my life. It was also served with the usual sambar and coconut chutney.

Filter coffee served in "station vatkis" is certainly a class apart. Completely refreshing.

The Pineapple sheera was just awesome. I could relish the taste for quite long after leaving the place.

They also have a pan shop right outside to end the visit on a high. We did not indulge in that though.

The entire affair cost us about 150 rupees which is almost nothing compared to the awesome food they serve.

Final verdict:
==============
* Ambience: 3/5
* Food: 4.5/5
* Service: 4/5
* Value for money: 5/5
* Overall: 4/5
