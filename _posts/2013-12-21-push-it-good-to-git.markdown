title: "How to “Push It Good” to Git"
---

Yesterday while I saw a tweet regarding [Push it to Good to Git in MAC][]. It was interesting so I built up a quick hack to do the same on linux.

I was initially looking to use Sound Cloud coz well spotify doesn't work in India yet! Just then Dilawar wrote an interesting post on [confiuring MPC/MPD][] on [WnCC Google Group][]
So I just wrote a mini bash to emulate the push it to good to git for MAC!

###Instructions###
* chmod +rx pushit
* sudo mv pushit /usr/bin/

###Usage###
* pushit {branch-name}

###Credits###
* Inspired by [Push it to Good to Git in MAC][]
* Credits to configure mpc @dilawar
* [Push it By Salt N Pepa][]
