REVIEW:
======

We ordered a couple of pizzas for home delivery from eagle boys pizza. So this review is primarily on the food and their service in general. Thanks to one of their promos on Zomato we could avail a buy one get one free offer.

We ordered a double cheese margherita and a country special pizza (both medium).
Compared to Domino's their pizza base was very soft and was akin to those at pizza hut. The pizzas were overall good, the toppings were generous.

They also have a very exhaustive menu almost similar to other pizza brands.

However, when it comes to value for money this place is spot on. They have quite a few offers running on weekdays and thus we can get a pizza at almost 30% less prize as compared to other brands.

Service is a bit slow, our order took approx 50 minutes to be delivered. So by the time we were having the second pizza, it wasn't hot. They could certainly improve on this front.

Overall we had a pleasant experience.

FINAL VERDICT:
=============
Food : 3.5/5
Value for money : 4/5
Service : 3.5/5
Overall I would rate the place to 3.5/5
