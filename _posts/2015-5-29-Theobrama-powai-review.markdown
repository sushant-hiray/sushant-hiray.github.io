REVIEW:
======

Dessert craving? This is your place to be. Situated at Central Avenue, Hiranandani Gardens this one is a tiny cozy outlet.

AMBIANCE
=========
The place is tiny. It offers two types of seating, a table for 2 and 4. The takeaway counter is well separated from the dining area which is a plus. Although small, the interior is pretty and has bright white lighting.


FOOD
=====
I've been to the place numerous times. The place is amazing for desserts and English breakfast. The must try list would include: French toast, Kejriwal and pancakes.

French toast are made on croissants and are really yum.

Have the pan cakes for breakfast and they make your day. The pancakes are served with fruits, maple syrup and cream. The sweetness of the syrup, quickly followed by the delicate, buttery flavor of the pancake just makes eating it an amazing experience. The coolness of the syrup complemented the heat of the cake.

We also had a chocolate brownie, it was good but more on the sweet side.


SERVICE
=======
Early morning the service is not so sharp and is extremely slow. I've had days of awesome service and poor service, so I would say it is just average.

VALUE FOR MONEY
===============
The desserts are optimally priced compared to similar other dessert chains. They also offer 50% off on takeaway after 8 or 9, that is certainly a steal.

FINAL VERDICT
=============

* Food : 4.5/5
* Service: 3/5
* Ambiance: 4/5
* Vfm: 4/5
* Overall: 4/5
