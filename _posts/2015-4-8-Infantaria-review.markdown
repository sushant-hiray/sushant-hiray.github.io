REVIEW:
======

After a long tiring day at the beach we tried searching for some recommended restaurants and our search ended at Infantaria. On entering the place there is a small bakery counter. Seeing those desserts lined up outside was an utter delight. The place was bubbling with energy, thanks to some awesome live music.

FOOD:
====
The menu was pretty elaborate with surprisingly large options for my vegetarian friends. I'll stick to reviewing the non veg portions. We started off with fish fingers along with tartar sauce. It was crispy from outside and soft on inside, overall nicely made. We had read that chicken biryani was worth a try from some previous reviews, so we gave it a try. Thanks to the reviewer we enjoyed one of the better biryanis I've ever tasted, it was medium spicy and had enough to serve a guy more than enough.
For desserts we ordered a hot sizzling brownie. It was pretty good too.

SERVICE:
========
The service was prompt although it did appear that they had less number of waiters to manage the overflowing crowd.

Overall a really great experience to end the day.

FINAL VERDICT:
=============

* Ambiance: 4/5
* Food: 4.5/5
* Service: 4/5
* Value for money: 3/5
* Overall: 4/5
