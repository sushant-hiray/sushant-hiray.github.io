title: "30 Days of Github Streaking"
---

This winter I started off with an interesting aim, trying to maximize my commit streak on github.
<br/>
First of all, it’s really fun to see your stats (the green graph on your profile), and once you have a streak going, you should avoid breaking it! C'mon who likes seeing gray idle zones in a green graph!

It all started when I was working on <a href="http://sushant-hiray.github.io/tshn/">TSHN</a> I noticed that I had bettered my previous best was of 17 days streak! It was a lack-luster streak that I wanted to improve but just couldn’t find enough motivation. 
<br/>And <bold>bang</bold> I broke my streak in just  <a href="https://github.com/sushant-hiray?tab=contributions&from=2013-12-13">3 days</a> :(
<br/>
So I decided to set up a task for myself.
<br/>
<br/>
<h3>The 30 day challenge</h3>
<br/>
The task was simple: to keep the streak for atleast 30 days. <br/>
I started this streak off with a bang, contributing nearly <a href="https://github.com/sushant-hiray?tab=contributions&from=2013-12-15">20 commits</a> to my <a href="http://sushant-hiray.github.io/">website<a/> and other various projects on the second day. Soon I wen past that with <a href="https://github.com/sushant-hiray?tab=contributions&from=2013-12-17">34 contributions</a>This actually happened to be the most contributions in a single day that I made throughout the current streak.
