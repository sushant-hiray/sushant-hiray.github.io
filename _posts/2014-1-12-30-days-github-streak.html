title: "30 Days of Github Streaking"
---

This winter I started off with an interesting aim, trying to maximize my commit streak on github.
<br/>
First of all, it’s really fun to see your stats (the green graph on your profile), and once you have a streak going, you should avoid breaking it! C'mon who likes seeing gray idle zones in a green graph!

It all started when I was working on <a href="http://sushant-hiray.github.io/tshn/">TSHN</a> I noticed that I had bettered my previous best of a measly 3 day streak! It was a lack-luster streak that I wanted to improve but just couldn’t find enough motivation. 
<br/>And <bold>bang</bold> I broke my streak very <a href="https://github.com/sushant-hiray?tab=contributions&from=2013-12-13">next day</a> :(

So I decided to set up a task for myself.
