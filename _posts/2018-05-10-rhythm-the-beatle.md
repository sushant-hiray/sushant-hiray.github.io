REVIEW:
======

Rhythm is located on the lobby level at the Beatle Hotel. Rhythm offers a buffet and an extensive a la carte meal. We recently visited Rhythm during their ongoing mango festival. The entire menu inspired by the king of fruits! That includes appetizers, mains and desserts. And when it comes to mangoes, who wouldn't love to have it with every dish of the meal.

We kickstarted the meal with aam panna. A tangy teaser for the mangolicious meal we were about to devour.

While glossing over the menu, my eyes stuck right at Avocado. The dish being Tacos with Mango & Avocado Salsa. It is just one of those combos, which can be a great hit or a disaster. Thankfully, it was former. Teeny-tiny crisy tacos filled with a medley of mango, avocado, bellpepper, salsa and of course cheese. Definitely would've loved a hint of guac.

Up next were Mango Fritters. Deep-fried `<anything>` always sounds good. Well, deep-fried mango slices were almost as good as they sound. However, they were served with lemon aioli, which was quite a weird combination to start with. The flavors weren't complimentary and so the dip ended up being useless. One does wonder how would fried-aamras (akin to fried ice-cream) taste. Perhaps a better replacement for the current variant. 

Following the appetizers we moved on to mains.

Traditional Raw Mango Pickle with Nachni Bhakri 
A childhood favorite and almost a staple food at my native place. This is one of the most popular dishes of the menu. After all getting fresh pickle in the city is itself a task. Small nachni bhakris were served with raw mango pickle, chutney and your usual salad.

Next we called on for a serving Chicken Appam. Bite-sized chicken and mangoes cooked in an onion/tomato gravy. I was quite skeptical of the combination, but was proved wrong on many levels. The appams were soft, however weren't consistent across servings. The dish also contains a vegetarian counterpart, with chicken replaced by paneer.

Finally, moving to the desserts! Tiramisu <3 More often than not, flavored tiramisu's don't do enough justice to the flavors. But this one certainly did. Elegant plating and topped with a raspberry foam and seasoned with dried raw mangoes. This one looks as good as it tastes. 

Mango Cheesecake. Subtly flavored cheesecake, with sliced mangoes on the top. With cheesecakes these good, you don't need to look any further for your next executive lunch place.
