REVIEW:
======

After watching an interesting play at Prithvi Theatre we decided to try some place different to eat apart from the usual Prithvi cafe. A quick search on Zomato led us to this place. After an eventful 20 minute ride, we reached the destination. The place stands apart from the neighborhood. It's a small, vibrant cafe and we hoped our long ride to the cafe better be worth it.

AMBIANCE
=========
The lively atmosphere with a mix of good songs and bright colors cheers you up almost instantly. The walls are covered with graffiti arts. One of the highlights of the ambiance are the table tops. All of the table tops are painted differently and some of them have quotes too. My personal favorite was the fusion of batman and joker (check the images).

Each table also has a deck of UNO cards. They also have various other board games. You can also ask for other games depending on the liking of your gang. The servers are knowledgeable and can help you teach a game ðŸ˜„

FOOD
=====
Having all set with our UNO cards, we decided to get started with food.
We ordered 3 dishes: crunch chicken (INR 209), Non veg Alfredo pasta (INR 299), Paneer Steak Gunzanio sizzler (INR 299).

Crunch chicken : This extra crunchy oven fried chicken was an instant favorite. The extra crispy added to the joy of eating. We're too busy eating and almost forgot about our UNO game.

Next came Alfredo pasta. Light seasoned grilled chicken tossed in a rich creamy white sauce over a bed of hot penne pasta. The white creamy sauce made our day.

For the main course we decided Paneer Steak Gunzanio Sizzler. It was paneer Steak in pepper sauce served along with fettuccini pasta, fries and veggies. The paneer was soft, perhaps a tad too soft and crumbled into pieces once we started tearing it apart. The fries could've been crisper. Overall I would rate this as an average dish.

SERVICE
=======
The service was quick and the server was knowledgeable about the menu and ofcourse various board games.

FINAL VERDICT:
=============

* Food: 3.5/5
* Ambiance: 4/5
* Service: 4/5
* Vfm: 4/5
* Overrall: 4/5
