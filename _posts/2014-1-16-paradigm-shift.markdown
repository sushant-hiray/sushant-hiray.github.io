title: "Paradigm Shift"

Most people come into your life temporarily simply to teach you something. They come and go. But some people stay. Some of them bring about a change we never thought would happen. Sometimes it will feel weird when you realize you spent so much time with someone till they become an integral part of yours and once they do become we tend to become careless. But that’s exactly how it’s supposed to be.
