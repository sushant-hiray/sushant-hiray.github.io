<p>
Bitten by the travel bug, a foodie to the core, tech savvy and übergeek. <br/> Sushant just graduated after studying CS at IIT Bombay. When he is not coding, he is eating or sometimes doing both, while listening to instrumentals. He loves running marathons (no kidding) – of the TV Series kind. <br/> In other lives, he is a notorious domain hoarder(hush!). He also reviews restaurants at <a href="http://eatreviewrepeat.wordpress.com/"> Eat. Review. Repeat </a> <br/>
He is <em>sushant-hiray</em> on most services.</p>
