> Dear Ygritte,

By the time you get this, you are officially starting a new revolution around the Sun, a new chapter is about to dawn. I think you are quite mad at me or not talking or wishing you. But well, I think we aren't the usual ones, we are the misfits, the rebels living far off in centuries behind where posts are delivered by hand, so I figured this might very well land a bit late on your plate.

```
Leaving your bygone years behind, 
what's in front of you, you're yet to find.
```

Oh, you beautiful, wonderful, brilliant girl. I wish I could travel back in time and squeeze you and hug you and tell you all about the amazing adventures you're going to have this year. You'll soon enter the next year at college and well you've done pretty well there. Awesome creativity anyone? All's well that ends well after all. Real life now seems both light years away and scarily fast-approaching. 

You'll have to please people just so that they don't screw you, but well, that's life. You will find people from all walks of life. There are certain things you might have to change, but well today's not the day to talk about them. 

There are going to be people who tell you you're not good enough. Not smart enough. Not talented enough. Not beautiful enough. Not thin enough. Let the pain they cause thicken your skin, but don't carry them with you; they don't deserve your attention. You have much more important things to focus on. (Read SNOW ;-) )

There will be guys. So many guys. So many completely-wrong-but-totally-right-in-the-moment guys. Guys with no ambition. Guys who aspire to run the world. Guys you don't actually like very much, but think you should go out with anyway. Some of them will hurt your heart, but I hope that none will succeed in breaking it. There will always be one guy silently watching your back.

```
So here's something that's good to remember
All year long from January to December
Life's not about what is given on your plate
In the end, it's about what you create
```

You have adventure, success and love to look forward to.

Lots of love
<3
